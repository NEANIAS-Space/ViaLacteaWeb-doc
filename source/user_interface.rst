User Interface
==============

After successful login the user is redirected to VLW web page with application main interface. The Web UI is designed as similar as possible to the UI of `ViaLactea desktop version <https://docs.neanias.eu/projects/s1-service/en/latest/services/vialactea.html>`_. The UI components are inspired by the desktop version of ViaLactea but adapted for use within browser and different versions of screen Desktop/Tablet/Mobile.

ViaLactea Web 2.0 provides tools for analysis of 2D and 3D results of VLKB queries. The 2D and 3D data analysis functionality is provided in seperate tabs of a web browser. For testing purposes, the visualisation of local 3D FITS files is also supported. The current interface layout that covers a visualisation of 2D data is presended in :numref:`webfigtwodim` .
