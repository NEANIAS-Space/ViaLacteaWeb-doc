Access to the VLKB service
==========================
To receive an access to VLKB service, follow the steps below:

1) Open the NEANIAS SMS page using this `link <https://sms.neanias.eu/projects/neanias-sms/issues/new?issue[tracker\_id]=13&amp;issue[subject]=Access+request+for+ViaLactea>`

2) Login with NEANIAS SSO using a Microsoft or Google account.

3) Fill and submit the access request form. You will access all public surveys by default. If you want to ask for access to private surveys you can select the surveys by selecting the checkboxes in the ViaLactea surveys field. There are four private surveys currently available. The &quot;AllPrivate&quot; option includes all of them.

4) You will receive email notifications by the NEANIAS SMS about the processing of your access request. When the request is taken care of, the status will change to &quot;Under development&quot;. Once the status is set to &quot;Resolved&quot;, you can access the service.
